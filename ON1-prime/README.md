# ON1-prime

## Goal:

Please write a C++ program that reads a list of numbers from a STL
collection and for each number determine if the number is prime.
The prime check should occur in a secondary thread and put the results
in a STL data structure. Use two worker threads to perform the
calculations (one prime number per thread).

## Possible algorithms

1. Trial Division (Basic Method)
1. Sieve of Eratosthenes (For Finding Primes up to a Limit)
1. Probabilistic Primality Tests (Miller-Rabin)
1. Deterministic Primality Tests (AKS Primality Test)
